                  There’s a carnival game at the Iolani Fair called Bank Shot. You have to roll a ball on a ramp into a hole and win a prize. Get it in the green hole and you win tickets, and if you get it in the red hole, you win a big inflatable prize. I wondered what was the rate of hitting the red and green holes.
Here’s a picture of the game layout.

                  My wife and I like iced coffee but drinking it at Starbucks is expensive. I&rsquo;ve been making it myself at home and it&rsquo;s a reasonable facsimile at what I think is a much lower price. I decided to run the calculations to see how much we&rsquo;re saving.
Grounds I tried a bunch of different coffees to see what would work the best: whole bean Kirkland (Costco) brand, whole bean Kona coffee, ground Lion coffee (a local brand), ground Folgers, and ground Kirkland.

                  Last month I went to the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Annual Leadership Forum. This is a meeting of local chapter leaders from across the country where we make resolutions for the AAP to act on. Some resolutions were passed quickly as a group because they were not controversial. This process is called the “consent calendar”. The other resolutions were debated, sometimes at much length, before being voted on individually. At the end of the meeting we came up with the top 10 resolutions that we wanted the AAP to work on this year.

                  From listening to my favorite fantasy baseball podcast it seems that there is a belief that teams that score lots of runs are not likely to produce saves. The idea seems to be that such teams would blow out their competitors and so have less opportunity for games to be saved. While it made sense, I wondered what the data said.

                  My wife’s high school biology students did a lab recently and had difficulty graphing the pooled data. One student allegedly took 2 hours to figure out how to do this in Excel. This seemed like it would be a nice exercise to try in the Hadleyverse. To replicate this plot, I had to take her students’ data in wide form, tidy it up, calculate means for each group and time, and then plot these.

                  I was listening to my fantasy baseball podcast last week, and the conversation turned to the Phillies closer situation. One host suggested that the Phillies might not have any pitcher with more than 10 saves this season. The other host thought that this would be unlikely. They looked quickly at the data and found that this has happened a few times since 2000. I wondered if there was a way to look this up using the Lahman database in R.

                  I was evolving some Pokemon in Pokemon Go and wondered how much the Pokemon’s attributes change after evolution. The attributes of interest were combat power (CP) and hit points (HP). I focused my analysis from Pidgeys because I had the most data points for this species.
I collected data from a couple of days’ evolution, available for viewing here. Both times I was using a Lucky Egg.

                  I was listening to my fantasy baseball podcast last week, and the conversation turned to the Phillies closer situation. One host suggested that the Phillies might not have any pitcher with more than 10 saves this season. The other host thought that this would be unlikely. They looked quickly at the data and found that this has happened a few times since 2000. I wondered if there was a way to look this up using the Lahman database in R.

                  My coworker keeps a list of our coworkers’ birthdays so she can plan a monthly celebration. There are 36 of us in the office, and it turns out that none of us have the same birthday. My coworker wondered what was the chance of that happening.
As it turns out, the birthday problem is a classic probability question. Given a certain number of people, what is the probability that two of them have the same birthday?

                  In Hawaii, electric cars park for free at state owned parking lots. This is a big benefit when we travel since the airport parking lot is normally $18 per day. I wondered how much money the state loses on the electric car parking at the airport. Because I travel to Maui every week for work, I was able to collect some data to try to answer this question.
Methods I made video recordings of parked cars while driving through the Honolulu International Airport interisland parking structure between November 29, 2016 and December 28, 2016.

                  A post about automating Secret Santa assignments popped up in my Facebook feed the other day. This being the Christmas season, I took a look. It seemed a bit complex, and I wondered if I could make it more efficient.
The original function took in a list of people (e.g., Ann, Bill, Chris). Using a nested while-for loop, it randomly picked a name (Bill), and matched it to the first person in the list (Ann:Bill).
