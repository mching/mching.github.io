                  On the baseball podcast I listen to, guest host AJ Mass proposed that a rule of thumb for a top 20 pitcher would be someone with an ERA &lt; 3.5 and a K/BB ratio of &gt; 3.5 (3.5 + 3.5 = 7). I wondered if this was actually the case (i.e., how many pitchers achieve this mark each season).
Methods I turned as usual to the Lahman database and the tidyverse packages.

                  Recently I have been exploring the blogdown package to redo my website using Hugo, and it resurrected an old idea that I had. Security Now, one of my favorite podcasts, has transcriptions of each episode, and I thought it would be neat to put them into an e-book and read the old episodes that way. I tried using Calibre, but while it did work, I wasn’t able to figure out how to format it nicely.

                  I’ve decided to convert this website from Github Pages/Jekyll to Hugo. Th inspiration for this came when I saw the website that Roger Peng put up for his live data analysis screencasts, and there was a big Hugo logo on the bottom. After learning more about this and discovering the blogdown package by Yihui Xie that is based on Hugo, I decided to take the leap in converting my Jekyll Github Pages site to Hugo (hosted on Github Pages).

                  I wanted to try my hand at some text mining using the tidytext package, and I was wondering what I could look at. I love the podcast Security Now! by Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte, and I’ve always wondered if there was a way to build a good index of their podcast.
I used the tidyverse packages and tidytext by David Robinson. He and Julia Silge wrote the book from which most of these methods came from.

                  I just finished my 2017 Reading Challenge on Goodreads. My goal was to read 15 books this year. Poking around the site I discovered that I could export my data. I decided to have a look to see what my reading habits looked like, and since I was doing this for me, I decided to look at my wife’s data too.

                  The kids brought home their yearbooks this past week, and it was time to settle a question that I have had for a long time. Do kids who enter their private school at kindergarten do better or worse than the kids who enter later?

                  I just finished my 2017 Reading Challenge on Goodreads. My goal was to read 15 books this year. Poking around the site I discovered that I could export my data. I decided to have a look to see what my reading habits looked like, and since I was doing this for me, I decided to look at my wife’s data too.

                  I read in the newspaper that the University of Hawaii was recruiting “citizen scientists” to help document the impact of this week’s “king tides” on our coastline. I uploaded some photos to the website but also found that we could download the dataset. I took this as an opportunity to learn something about geographic information systems (GIS) and R, and the end result was a pretty nice map of all the places that were photographed this week.

                  On my favorite fantasy baseball podcast, the host mentioned the phenomenon of pitchers who had more saves than strikeouts. This seemed like it would be fairly uncommon since it seems that many closers are power pitchers (e.g., Aroldis Chapman). I decided to investigate further using the Lahman database.
Methods I used the Lahman database again, which is perfect for answering this kind of questions. It has a Pitching table that contains season long stats for every pitcher from 1871 to 2015 (as of this post).

                  My wife and I like iced coffee but drinking it at Starbucks is expensive. I&rsquo;ve been making it myself at home and it&rsquo;s a reasonable facsimile at what I think is a much lower price. I decided to run the calculations to see how much we&rsquo;re saving.
Grounds I tried a bunch of different coffees to see what would work the best: whole bean Kirkland (Costco) brand, whole bean Kona coffee, ground Lion coffee (a local brand), ground Folgers, and ground Kirkland.
