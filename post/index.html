                  I had to organize the Tenderfoot scouts in my troop to learn some orienteering. The first step is to calculate how long their paces are. We went to the track and measured their pace count per 100 meters at least twice per scout. I wondered what the distribution looked like.
I used dplyr method to group and summarize the data. It’s a little overkill but it does make it super easy.

                  Today I ran an experiment with the students in my daughter’s First Lego League team. It was meant to demonstrate how fluid shifts in space. The kids measured their leg circumference at 3 different spots after standing for 10 minutes. They lay with their legs propped up in the air for 10 more minutes and then re-measured the circumference.
The inspiration for this activity came from the NASA website.

I’ve been having a hard time with my long runs now that the weather is getting hot. I went on one in particular that was particularly tough. I was nauseous and felt hot afterwards for a long time. I probably had heat exhaustion. The next morning when I weighed myself I was about 5 lbs less than I thought I should be. This got me thinking that maybe I was also very dehydrated, even though I had taken water breaks at several water stops along the way.

                  I find it hard to pace myself on the road when doing interval workouts. The GPS apps aren’t good enough to maintain a steady pace at the goal so I always end up running too fast at the beginning then die at the end. I’ve found it easier to do these on the treadmill at the gym. The only problem is that it’s hard for me to convert between the paces I want to run and the miles per hour speed that are supplied by the treadmills.

                  Last summer I started running again after about 8 years off. I had run from my sophomore year of high school until the fall of 2008 when it seemed like I had a meniscus injury and I stopped running. I had run for 17 years, during which the longest break I had taken was maybe a few months. After I stopped, I always missed it, and when my son started training for a Scouting running achievement, I decided I would keep him company.

                  I find it hard to pace myself on the road when doing interval workouts. The GPS apps aren’t good enough to maintain a steady pace at the goal so I always end up running too fast at the beginning then die at the end. I’ve found it easier to do these on the treadmill at the gym. The only problem is that it’s hard for me to convert between the paces I want to run and the miles per hour speed that are supplied by the treadmills.

                  I lifted weights regularly for two years but stopped recently because I decided to run more instead. I tracked my weight lifting using an app called Strong, and since it seemed that I had reached my peak of weight lifting I figured I would look back on my exercise over this time.

                  It’s been a while since I posted, but this weekend I returned to the American Academy of Pediatrics Annual Leadership Forum and I was able to cite my analysis on the top 10 resolutions.
In the spirit of looking further at the ALF data I decided to look at the voting records from this year. It seemed that most votes pass by at least 80% if not more. This includes the amendment votes.

                  The local newspaper released a dataset of high school all stars from 1972 to 2017, and I thought it might be interesting to analyze the information. Some interesting questions were what schools have the most all stars, at what positions, and how this has changed over the years. I suspect that Saint Louis, Kahuku, and Waianae will be the top teams but who knows? Maybe there’s a secret dynasty that I never heard of.

                  (Updated to add googlesheets methodology and new data points)
I’ve seen some posts online suggesting that the miles per gallon estimates that your car provides are not accurate. I collected a few observations to see if this was true for my car.
Methods Each time I filled up the gas tank, I collected the number of gallons that were dispensed until the first automatic shutoff. I wrote down the estimated mpg, the trip odometer reading since the last fill-up, and the overall odometer reading.
