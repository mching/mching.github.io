      <description>The local newspaper released a dataset of high school all stars from 1972 to 2017, and I thought it might be interesting to analyze the information. Some interesting questions were what schools have the most all stars, at what positions, and how this has changed over the years. I suspect that Saint Louis, Kahuku, and Waianae will be the top teams but who knows? Maybe thereâ€™s a secret dynasty that I never heard of.</description>

      <description>The regular fantasy football season just finished, and as usual, my team underperformed. I had the 3rd most points in the league and finished 7 out of 8 teams with a record of 4-8. I wondered what were the chances of such a bad record. This called for a simulation!
Methods I transcribed all the scores for each game into a spreadsheet and loaded it into R.

      <description>Introduction The purpose of this document is to explore the most yards in a shutout loss for a college football team. It was inspired after the University of Hawai`i gave up 462 yards in shutting out San Jose State on November 15, 2014. I wanted to see if I could use the dplyr package to explore this question.
