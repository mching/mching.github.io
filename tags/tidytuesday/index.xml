      <description>I just found out about Tidy Tuesday, an educational exercise from the R for Data Science folks. The idea is that they publish a dataset every Tuesday for people to play around with. If you make something you’re proud of you can publish it on Twitter and use the hashtag #tidytuesday. I haven’t tried it before, but today’s one was a topic that was of interest to me–computer security and passwords.</description>
