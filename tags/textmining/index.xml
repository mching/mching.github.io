      <description>In the Security Now podcast, the hosts Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte often cite episodes that explain certain basic topics. They can never remember which episode covered a certain topic (e.g., how TLS works). As a follow-up to my previous post about text mining with the tidytext package, I decided to use see if I could make it easier to create an index for the series using term frequency and inverse document frequency analysis (tf-idf).</description>

      <description>I wanted to try my hand at some text mining using the tidytext package, and I was wondering what I could look at. I love the podcast Security Now! by Steve Gibson and Leo Laporte, and Iâ€™ve always wondered if there was a way to build a good index of their podcast.
I used the tidyverse packages and tidytext by David Robinson. He and Julia Silge wrote the book from which most of these methods came from.</description>
