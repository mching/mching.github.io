      <description>I’ve been happy with Hugo to publish my blog, and I thought it would be cool to use it to revamp my personal webpage at the University of Hawaii. It turned out it wasn’t as easy as I thought it would be.
I created a new site using blogdown and the hugo_identity_theme.
new_site(theme = &amp;quot;aerohub/hugo-identity-theme&amp;quot;)) After playing around with the config.toml, I was ready to push the page to the university server.</description>
