      <description>Today I ran an experiment with the students in my daughterâ€™s First Lego League team. It was meant to demonstrate how fluid shifts in space. The kids measured their leg circumference at 3 different spots after standing for 10 minutes. They lay with their legs propped up in the air for 10 more minutes and then re-measured the circumference.
The inspiration for this activity came from the NASA website.</description>
