      <description>My son is in a robotics competition this year. He has to score points by driving a robot around a course and making it pick up and place things. I thought it might be nice to chart his progress.
The real learning issue for today is using the googlesheets package to work with the data. I often enter data using this site and it would save me a lot of time to get the data directly from Google Sheets rather than downloading it as a csv.</description>
