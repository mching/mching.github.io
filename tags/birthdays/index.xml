      <description>This past year our family members were 43, 43, 13, and 11 years old, which are all prime numbers. I wondered if there was or will be any other year where this will happen. There was probably a real math way to figure this out, but it was easier just to brute force calculate each year.
I took out the obvious years (where we are even ages), so starting when our daughter was born, I calculated how old each of us was or will be.</description>
