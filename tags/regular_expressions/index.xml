      <description>Our fax machine at work has been very slow lately. One of our frequently faxed numbers complained that it took over an hour to send a fax. Googling this problem didnâ€™t result in any solutions, other than maybe learning that this is a common problem with fax over IP telephony. I decided to take a closer look at the logs.
The logs are printed out roughly every day or two.</description>
