      <description>It’s fantasy baseball season again, and it was time for my kids to do their draft with my friend’s kids. None of them know anything about baseball players except for the very top stars (Mookie Betts, Mike Trout), so they rely a lot on analyst predictions. Of course, one person’s predictions are not always that great, so inspired by Nate Silver, I set out to build a combination of several models to see if I could get a more accurate outcome.</description>

      <title>Exploring Disabled List Data from Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>/2017/07/17/dl-data-exploration/</link>

      <description>I was interested in the duration of certain injuries for baseball players. It’s difficult to get data on this although I discovered a series of Google Sheets that documented disabled list (DL) stays over the years. I combined these sheets and cleaned these up manually. I entered these into R and crunched the data.
Methods I downloaded the data from Google and used the tidyverse tools to look at them.</description>

      <title>AJ Mass’s Rule of Sevens</title>
      <link>/2017/07/03/rule-of-sevens/</link>

      <description>On the baseball podcast I listen to, guest host AJ Mass proposed that a rule of thumb for a top 20 pitcher would be someone with an ERA &amp;lt; 3.5 and a K/BB ratio of &amp;gt; 3.5 (3.5 + 3.5 = 7). I wondered if this was actually the case (i.e., how many pitchers achieve this mark each season).
Methods I turned as usual to the Lahman database and the tidyverse packages.</description>

      <title>Justin Smoak and BABIP Trends</title>

      <description>The podcast I listen to said something like, “I bet Justin Smoak must have one of the lowest BABIPs of anyone to this point in his career.” I thought it might be a good chance to explore this nebulous BABIP a little, what are the historical league and career trends in BABIP. Maybe 3 sentences are needed.
Or maybe a second paragraph. Or 2.

      <title>Pitchers with More Saves than Strikeouts</title>
      <link>/2017/05/21/saves-vs-strikeouts/</link>

      <description>On my favorite fantasy baseball podcast, the host mentioned the phenomenon of pitchers who had more saves than strikeouts. This seemed like it would be fairly uncommon since it seems that many closers are power pitchers (e.g., Aroldis Chapman). I decided to investigate further using the Lahman database.
Methods I used the Lahman database again, which is perfect for answering this kind of questions. It has a Pitching table that contains season long stats for every pitcher from 1871 to 2015 (as of this post).</description>

      <title>Effect of Runs and Other Factors on Team Saves in Major League Baseball</title>
      <link>/2017/04/18/saves-and-runs-scored/</link>

      <guid>/2017/04/18/saves-and-runs-scored/</guid>
      <description>From listening to my favorite fantasy baseball podcast it seems that there is a belief that teams that score lots of runs are not likely to produce saves. The idea seems to be that such teams would blow out their competitors and so have less opportunity for games to be saved. While it made sense, I wondered what the data said.
library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(ggplot2) library(Lahman) data(&amp;quot;Teams&amp;quot;) Teams &amp;lt;- tbl_df(Teams) Exploration of Saves over Time Saves did not become an official statistic until 1969 (source).</description>

      <title>Baseball Team Season Save Leaders with the Lowest Totals since 2000</title>

      <description>I was listening to my fantasy baseball podcast last week, and the conversation turned to the Phillies closer situation. One host suggested that the Phillies might not have any pitcher with more than 10 saves this season. The other host thought that this would be unlikely. They looked quickly at the data and found that this has happened a few times since 2000. I wondered if there was a way to look this up using the Lahman database in R.</description>
