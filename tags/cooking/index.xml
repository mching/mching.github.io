      <description>Another Thanksgiving has gone by and another set of turkey roasting data is available.
This year’s turkey was quite a bit bigger than last year’s one (20 vs 14 lbs) because we usually roast one and buy another. The place we buy from wasn’t selling hot turkeys, so we decided to just make one big one. Other than the size, we used the same method as last year (see last year’s post).</description>
