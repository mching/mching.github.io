      <title>How Much Water Garbanzo Beans Absorb in an Overnight Soak</title>

      <description>I made a recipe for falafel today that involved soaking dry garbanzo beans/chickpeas. I happened to have weighed the dry garbanzo beans before soaking to see how much I had. Before soaking I had 403 g beans. After soaking in tap water at 77 degrees F the weight was 795 g. The beans gained 392 g of water or 97.3% of their dry weight. That’s close enough to call it double!</description>

      <description>We started a new family Christmas Eve tradition with roast prime rib. This year was a 6.61 lb bone on prime rib.
library(dplyr) ## ## Attaching package: &amp;#39;dplyr&amp;#39; ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:stats&amp;#39;: ## ## filter, lag ## The following objects are masked from &amp;#39;package:base&amp;#39;: ## ## intersect, setdiff, setequal, union library(ggplot2) dat &amp;lt;- tbl_df(read.csv(&amp;quot;../datasets/Prime_rib_temp.csv&amp;quot;)) I followed the Serious Eats recipe.
I cut off the bone then salted and let the bones and meat dry brine overnight.</description>

      <title>Turkey Data 2019 Update</title>

      <description>Another Thanksgiving has come and gone and I have new data from this year’s 16 lb bird to add to the last time I updated this post.
An unexpected update problem was that the googlesheets package has been updated to googlesheets4 with new methods. I was able to figure out how to use the methods in blogdown and it opened a browser tab for me to authenticate. However it did so every time, so when I went to knit the actual HTML page, it hung, probably because I was not able to authenticate via the browser.</description>

      <title>Turkey Data from 2017: A Bigger Bird</title>

      <description>Another Thanksgiving has gone by and another set of turkey roasting data is available.
This year’s turkey was quite a bit bigger than last year’s one (20 vs 14 lbs) because we usually roast one and buy another. The place we buy from wasn’t selling hot turkeys, so we decided to just make one big one. Other than the size, we used the same method as last year (see last year’s post).</description>
