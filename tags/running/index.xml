      <description>I’m almost at the end of May, and I’m over 100 miles into this race. It’s been a bit tough so far because of the time trial I did last week, but I’m still trying to get some cushion on the August 31 deadline for the race.
On the Facebook group for this race they talk about the races between races. Some people look at their state standings. Others may do their name rankings (i.</description>

      <title>GVRAT Bib Numbers and Starting Date</title>

      <description>On the Facebook group for the Great Virtural Race across Tennessee, there was a post where people were complaining about recent entries (with correspondingly high bib numbers) logging miles all the way back to the start of the race. This is against the rules of the race in that you’re only supposed to start logging from the time you sign up. It’s not like I hadn’t thought of doing this myself, but since I was confident I would make it anyway, I didn’t take that step.</description>

      <description>Some more data fun with the Great Virtual Race across Tennessee. I decided I would like to look at how I’ve been doing in comparison to the other racers. I also added in the finishers (who are running back across Tennessee to Arkansas virtually).
One note about the data source for the finishers is that it is only complete from 5/1-5/17 for some reason. I suspect that this is because it’s about when the first finishers crossed the finish line.</description>

      <description>I joined the Great Virtual Race across Tennessee this summer. It’s by the guys who produce the Barkley Marathons, the crazy nearly impossible ultramarathon series. The goal for this event is to run across Tennessee virtually, a little more than 1000 km. Each day the data table is published as a csv and so I thought I would take a look at what I could do with it.
Some basics:</description>

      <description>The Hawaii high school cross country championship was held this weekend. At first, only the live time and place results were displayed, and there were no team scores calculated. That made me want to figure out how to get team scores out of the live results. Doing this also let me figure out some hypotheticals like what if the teams from division 1 and division 2 were combined in one race.</description>

      <description>Update: 8/25/2018
I’ve been having a hard time with my long runs now that the weather is getting hot. I went on one in particular that was particularly tough. I was nauseous and felt hot afterwards for a long time. I probably had heat exhaustion. The next morning when I weighed myself I was about 5 lbs less than I thought I should be. This got me thinking that maybe I was also very dehydrated, even though I had taken water breaks at several water stops along the way.</description>

      <title>Treadmill Charts for Running Paces</title>

      <description>I find it hard to pace myself on the road when doing interval workouts. The GPS apps aren’t good enough to maintain a steady pace at the goal so I always end up running too fast at the beginning then die at the end. I’ve found it easier to do these on the treadmill at the gym. The only problem is that it’s hard for me to convert between the paces I want to run and the miles per hour speed that are supplied by the treadmills.</description>
