      <description>My daughter started doing a science project on the ecology of the Heeia fishpond. She collected a bunch of data, but since sheâ€™s only a 5th grader, I thought she might need some help with the analysis.
The premise is that the fishpond has been overgrown by invasive mangrove plants. The organization that runs the fishpond has been clearing back the mangroves. This helps to restore the water in the pond.</description>
