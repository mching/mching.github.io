      <description>On the baseball podcast I listen to, guest host AJ Mass proposed that a rule of thumb for a top 20 pitcher would be someone with an ERA &amp;lt; 3.5 and a K/BB ratio of &amp;gt; 3.5 (3.5 + 3.5 = 7). I wondered if this was actually the case (i.e., how many pitchers achieve this mark each season).
Methods I turned as usual to the Lahman database and the tidyverse packages.</description>
