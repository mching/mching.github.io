      <description>It’s fantasy baseball season again, and it was time for my kids to do their draft with my friend’s kids. None of them know anything about baseball players except for the very top stars (Mookie Betts, Mike Trout), so they rely a lot on analyst predictions. Of course, one person’s predictions are not always that great, so inspired by Nate Silver, I set out to build a combination of several models to see if I could get a more accurate outcome.</description>

      <title>AJ Mass’s Rule of Sevens</title>

      <description>On the baseball podcast I listen to, guest host AJ Mass proposed that a rule of thumb for a top 20 pitcher would be someone with an ERA &amp;lt; 3.5 and a K/BB ratio of &amp;gt; 3.5 (3.5 + 3.5 = 7). I wondered if this was actually the case (i.e., how many pitchers achieve this mark each season).
Methods I turned as usual to the Lahman database and the tidyverse packages.</description>
