      <description>I joined the Great Virtual Race across Tennessee this summer. It’s by the guys who produce the Barkley Marathons, the crazy nearly impossible ultramarathon series. The goal for this event is to run across Tennessee virtually, a little more than 1000 km. Each day the data table is published as a csv and so I thought I would take a look at what I could do with it.
Some basics:</description>

      <title>Running Mileage in 2019</title>

      <description>After a great 2019 of running, I wanted to look back to see how far I had run. I regularly use a Garmin GPS watch to track my runs. The Garmin app and website let me look back at 12 months but after January 1, the 12 months was updated to February 2019 to January 2020 so I couldn’t see my 2019 totals anymore. I also sync to Strava but the Strava 2019 Year in Review mileage total (1216 miles) was off of the Garmin calculation that I saw at the end of December (~1300 miles).</description>

      <description>Update: 8/25/2018
I’ve been having a hard time with my long runs now that the weather is getting hot. I went on one in particular that was particularly tough. I was nauseous and felt hot afterwards for a long time. I probably had heat exhaustion. The next morning when I weighed myself I was about 5 lbs less than I thought I should be. This got me thinking that maybe I was also very dehydrated, even though I had taken water breaks at several water stops along the way.</description>

      <title>Treadmill Charts for Running Paces</title>

      <description>I find it hard to pace myself on the road when doing interval workouts. The GPS apps aren’t good enough to maintain a steady pace at the goal so I always end up running too fast at the beginning then die at the end. I’ve found it easier to do these on the treadmill at the gym. The only problem is that it’s hard for me to convert between the paces I want to run and the miles per hour speed that are supplied by the treadmills.</description>

      <description>Last summer I started running again after about 8 years off. I had run from my sophomore year of high school until the fall of 2008 when it seemed like I had a meniscus injury and I stopped running. I had run for 17 years, during which the longest break I had taken was maybe a few months. After I stopped, I always missed it, and when my son started training for a Scouting running achievement, I decided I would keep him company.</description>

      <title>Weight Training Data</title>

      <description>I lifted weights regularly for two years but stopped recently because I decided to run more instead. I tracked my weight lifting using an app called Strong, and since it seemed that I had reached my peak of weight lifting I figured I would look back on my exercise over this time.
