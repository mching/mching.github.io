      <description>Itâ€™s been a while since I posted, but this weekend I returned to the American Academy of Pediatrics Annual Leadership Forum and I was able to cite my analysis on the top 10 resolutions.
In the spirit of looking further at the ALF data I decided to look at the voting records from this year. It seemed that most votes pass by at least 80% if not more. This includes the amendment votes.</description>
